                                        I’m someone who enjoys learning a variety of new things, from a new coding
                                        language to cooking a 3-course meal. <br>
                                        I have a MBO 4 diploma for software and media developers. I learned a lot about
                                        HTML, CSS, SCSS,JavaScript, GitHub, and Node. I also learned about databases and
                                        apis.
                                        I’m someone that loves to learn new things, especially with coding, and I’m
                                        always interested in how it works and how I could apply it to my new or current
                                        projects to change or improve them. Besides coding, I also like cooking from
                                        time to time, playing board and card games, playing games online with friends,
                                        and going to the gym.

                                        I began my journey at Mbo Utrecht where I learned HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
                                        GitHub. I instantly fell in love with coding and wanted to learn everything
                                        about it, so I began to learn scss/sass because I became very interested in it.
                                        We then began utilizing node, apis, php, and object-oriented programming; from
                                        that point on, I started coming up with my own projects in an effort to stretch
                                        myself and learn new skills. I also completed a one-year internship at ing,
                                        where I learned a lot more about apis and what it's like to work in an office.

                                        This is my first ever project I started with someone else. I started this

                                        because the grandmother of my girlfriend rents her caravan from time to time,

                                        she always wanted a website to show people what they could do, so I started
                                        working on that.

                                        I want to make this app as my first ever. The app has storage space for your
                                        products.
                                        By spoilage date in a list. I want to make this for the following reason.
                                        Because I frequently witness individuals discarding food after forgetting about
                                        it.
                                        It spoils and goes bad. So I decided to set a challenge for myself and create
                                        that application.
                                        Would resolve this issue.

                                        first, I didn’t know what I should make, so I searched the Internet for
                                        different examples, and based on those, I decided that I wanted to make a small
                                        website with a lot of information.
